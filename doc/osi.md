This can be the index of the english version of my Bsc. thesis about the UARTBus
and infrastructure. Every part should also contains the todos and possible 
further development ways.


** TODOs **

- Port bootloader for microcontrollers other than Atmega328 or atmega168.
- bootloader: provide detailed device information (device manufacturer,
	device id)
- make application wrapper arduino library compatible
