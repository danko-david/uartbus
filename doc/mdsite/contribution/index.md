# UARTBus contribution

## Community contribution
If you already use this project, help others to get involved too.  
You can find communities in the [Community](/community/) page.


## Testing contribution
One of the main vision of the project is to operate across different kinds of
devices with different operation modes. Automated testing systems help a lot
about keeping the core functionalities working, but this still can't replace
tests done by hand. The most simplest and pleasant way to do this, to use UARTBus
in your project and share your technical problems as [github issues](https://github.com/danko-david/uartbus/issues).

## Developement contribution
Uartbus is an open-source project what you can freely modify.
If you want to improve the project directly send a topic branch [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
to the [project's main Github repository](https://github.com/danko-david/uartbus).
