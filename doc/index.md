# Documentation

## Examples

TODO:

- create an example with direct applications and minimal devices on 5 V bus
	without bus gateway.


## The UARTBus 

The best way to extract the details of different aspect of the bus design is to
use the OSI model.

See: [OSI based documentation index](./osi/index.md)

## UARTBus bus gateway

TODO:

- how to build a gateway
- required software (linux: socat)
- how to start an RPC server and connect applications to bus

## UARTBus RPC features and overview 

In this aspect, the documentation describes how RPC layer works, how can you
call a function provided by a microcontroller and how you get the response
of an RPC call. 

See: [RPC documentation index](./rpc/index.md)


## UARTBus host application, application upload and supported devices

TODO:

- ub host memory layout
- compilation scripts and uploading method
- arduino/wiringc compilation and upload
- add some general purpose example app code


## UARTBus BusDevice object models 

TODO

## Documentation TODOs
